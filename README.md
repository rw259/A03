Tutorial on how to use GitHub

Navigate to **GitHub.com** and create an account, from there you want to create a **repository** in that account and title the **repository** so that it is revelant to the project you are planning on creating. 

When you have finished intializing the **repository** you can begin to upload your project files inside of it, you would do this by **committing**/uploading your files to the master **branch**. 

Whenever a change is made to one of the files in your repo you **commit** so that the changes update the file tracker.
